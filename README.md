### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I use Github to host some of my projects that I think are interesting
- I have experience across the "full stack". Anywhere from designing circuits, embedded programming, database design, data analytics, mobile apps, or web development
- I mainly use code to answer questions
- One of my favorite projects to work with is OpenStreetMap. [My OSM summary stats](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/?karsonkevin2)
